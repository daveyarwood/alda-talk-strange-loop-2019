* Self-taught programmer
* Music degree from UNC (2008)
* Disability examiner (2008-2014)
* Created Alda (2012)
** Music composition programming language
* Software engineer at Adzerk (2014-)

== Introduction

2 minutes (**FIXME: revise time estimates**)

* Hello, Strange Loop! I'm here to tell you a story of love, marriage, and
  divorce. Not of people, but of programming languages.
** One of them is my brain-child, a music composition language called Alda, born
in Durham.
** The other language is Clojure, a JVM Lisp, born in New York.

* In order to tell this story, I also need to tell you a little bit about myself
  and my journey as a software developer.
** We'll start in the present day, and then we'll time travel a little bit and
I'll tell you about where Alda came from and how it came to be what it is today.
** Then we'll jump ahead and look into the future.

== Present day

* I'm Dave Yarwood, I'm a software engineer at Adzerk.
** We're the leading solution for developers who want to build their own
fully-customized ad serving platform from scratch in a matter of weeks.
*** _[insert other marketing jargon here, as suggested by Chris]_
** Adzerk is my first programming job. I've been there for almost 5 years now,
and I absolutely love it. The language that we use the most at Adzerk is
Clojure. I'm a big fan of Clojure, and that's a major reason why I ended up
working at Adzerk.

* In 2012, I started to design and begin to implement a music composition
  programming language called Alda.

* Before we get much further, I'm going to give you a quick demo of Alda.
  I think that most of you probably are not familiar with Alda, unless you were
  at Strange Loop during the past couple years, where you may have seen me give
  a lightning talk with a live demonstration, like I'm about to do here.
** I've given a few talks in the past where I introduced Alda and I talked about
the features of the language and how I use it to compose music.
** I will try to cover a little bit of that today in the fastest way possible,
but for this talk, I'd like to focus more on the history of Alda and its
interesting relationship with Clojure.
** If you're curious to hear more about the syntax and features of Alda, I would
encourage you to watch my previous talks, and also check out the Alda website,
which has links to documentation and a tutorial.

== Quick demo: Alda

5 minutes

* Show and play examples in editor.
** Demo of features using Alda v1.x
** Don't necessarily need to tell the audience that this is an older version of
Alda right off the bat. The basic features of Alda should be consistent from v1
to v2. Including attributes, which I don't need to explain right away are
actually Lisp S-expressions.
** Then demonstrate the inline Clojure code feature of Alda v1.
*** Say something to the effect of "I should mention that I'm using Alda
v1.whatever here.  There's a good reason for that. It's because I want to show
you this feature that Alda used to have built-in prior to version 2..."
*** alda-clj demo at the end of the talk will cover the same functionality



== 2004-2008

* I studied Music in school. I got my degree in Music Composition and Bassoon
  Performance.
** At the time, I was interested in programming, but I'd only dabbled a little
bit with BASIC and Visual Basic, and I'd made a few websites just for fun using
HTML and CSS.
** I happened to discover a music programming language called MML, which stands
for Music Macro Language.
*** MML dates back to the late 70's, when it was integrated with certain BASIC
operating systems and used to make music for video games.
*** There was also a huge chiptune Renaissance in the early 2000's, which became
a little bit of an obsession for me. I learned how to use a dialect of MML to
make music for the NES sound chip. Years later, MML would become a major
influence on the syntax of Alda.
** I took an introductory programming class as an elective and learned some
Java. I really enjoyed it, but I was already on the path to getting a Music
degree, so I sort of put programming aside for a while.

== 2008-2010 or so

* A couple years after I graduated college, my roommate at the time got me into
Linux.
** I started getting more and more into programming just through learning how
to customize my desktop environment, writing utility scripts, and learning how
to use the command line.
** Then I started to really discover my love of programming.
*** I wet my toes with Python and Ruby, then started broadening my horizons and
learning more about the various disciplines that can be applied to software
development.
*** I took to functional programming after learning a little bit of Haskell and
Erlang.
*** I discovered that I really enjoyed writing little command line tools to help
me accomplish day-to-day tasks, and finding ways to make art by writing code.

== 2012-2014

* At some point, I had a little daydream that turned into a full-on thought
  experiment. I wondered what it might be like if there were a programming
  environment that would allow me to compose music in a way that was flexible
  enough to meet my needs as a classically-trained composer.
** Would a text-based language allow me to express all of the concepts I'd
learned in music theory and composition classes?
** Would it make me more productive?
** How might the creative process be different?

* So I started to sketch out some syntax ideas, came up with a sort of rough,
  informal language spec, and then I set about trying to implement it.
** I made a couple of initial attempts in Python and Ruby, but I just wasn't
finding myself productive enough in those languages to be able to implement a
functional interpreter.
** I had also recently discovered Clojure and become fluent enough with it that
I was able to make another attempt at an Alda interpreter in Clojure, and that's
the one that would ultimately become Alda, version 1.
** I started working at Adzerk around the same time, and I was lucky enough to
receive some very good input and feedback on Alda from my coworkers.

== Evolution of Alda's architecture

== phase 1: just a single clojure program that does everything

1 minute

== phase 2: break out client as java program for better CLI experience

1 minute

== phase 3: replace server implementation (http -> zmq REQ/REP)

2 minutes

* brief introduction to ZeroMQ, a couple of socket types
* REQ/REP
* "lazy pirate" pattern for client-side reliability

== phase 4: add a worker process (zmq "paranoid pirate" pattern)

2 minutes

* need for server-side reliability
* DEALER/ROUTER sockets, "paranoid pirate" pattern
* increased complexity at this point, foisted upon the user to some extent

== next phase

== move most functionality into the client

1 minute

* server and worker go away
* new objective: client must be fast af
** and have minimal startup time
** native executable?

== minimal player process

4 minutes

* performs a minimal amount of what the worker currently performs, namely
  playback

* necessary to be a separate process because playback happens asynchronously

* new objective: general purpose
** could be driven by something other than the alda client
** driven by OSC
*** simpler than ZeroMQ, better track record of use for realtime audio
    applications
*** already supported by lots of things, a standard for audio programming

* brief introduction to OSC

* new objective: support live-coding

== shocking announcement

3 minutes

* i plan to reimplement alda using go and kotlin
** ...although maybe i won't?  graalvm and cljs->node are also options
** the point is, i've decided to decouple alda from clojure
*** enumerate reasons here (refer to alda-clj "history" document)
*** i realized that i could still use clojure to write alda scores in a way
    that doesn't require alda to be implemented in clojure
*** micha mentioned clojure's value as a prototyping language, words i've
    taken to heart
*** i was able to use clojure to quickly iterate to where alda is now, a feat
    that would have been tedious in a less concise/expressive language
*** the work at this point is simply to port the logic to a language better
    equipped to meet my goals for alda

== alda-clj

4 minutes

* show github repo
** basic example under Usage in README
** cljdoc: API docs, Getting Started guide

* Benefits of it being a Clojure library instead of built into Alda
** not tied to the set of dependencies included in the alda runtime
** full control of the program, can run it wherever you like
*** e.g. a script, a web application
** can leverage cljdoc to provide API docs

* Demonstrate basic usage in editor-connected REPL

* Demonstrate something you can do with alda-clj that you can't do with inline
  Clojure code in an Alda score.
** e.g. use a Clojure library to make music

== take questions

4 minutes

== TODO

* Revise time estimates
** The estimates above came from my HoC talk proposal, which was for a 30 minute
talk (including questions). At Strange Loop, it looks like I will have 40
minutes, including questions. So, there is about 10 additional minutes of wiggle
room.

* Pare down the introduction. I think it might be better to leave out some
  detailed history and focus on the technical details.
